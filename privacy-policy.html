        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>100% Local Storage:</strong> All data is stored exclusively on your Android device using secure local storage. We do NOT use cloud services, external databases, or remote servers. Your data never leaves your phone.
